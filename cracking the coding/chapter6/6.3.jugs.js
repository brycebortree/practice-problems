// You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, 
// and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). 
// How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? 
// Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling 
// up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

Fill the five quart jug, then remove three quarts by
pouring the water into there. Now: 2 quarts. Pour the 
2 into the 3 quart jug, then fill up the 5 quart jug
one more time. Pour out water until the 3 quart jug is
full. The five quart jug has ~exactly~ four quarts.
