// A bunch of people are living on an island, when a 
// visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed 
// people must leave the island as soon as possible. 
// There will be a flight out at 8:00pm every evening. 
// Each person can see everyone else's eye color, but 
// they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed 
// to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how 
// many people have blue eyes, although they do know that 
// at least one person does. How many days will it take the 
// blue-eyed people to leave?

If there is one blue-eyed person, then one day. (Takes
  own flight; self realization.)
If there are two blue-eyed people, two days. (See each 
  other realize there are two.)
C blue eyes, c nights. All leave on same night.

(This one I don't understand as much.)
