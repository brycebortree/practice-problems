// There is a building of 1OO floors. If an egg drops
// from the Nth floor or above, it will break. 
// If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break. 
// you're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number
// of drops for the worst case.

My first instinct is go up and up.
My second instinct is binary search.
My third instinct is to start at 10, increment by 5.

//formal answer to puzzle over
Egg 1 goes down by one, Egg 2 goes up by one. 
// Look up worst case balancing!!!
