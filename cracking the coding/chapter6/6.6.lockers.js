// There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins
// by opening all 100 lockers. Next, he closes every second 
// locker. Then, on his third pass, he toggles every third 
// locker (closes it if it is open or opens it if it is 
//   closed). This process continues for 100 passes, such 
// that on each pass i, the man toggles every ith locker. 
// After his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles 
// only locker #100,how many lockers are open?
